## Introduction

Our full stack project  is called 'BeautyPal'. It was made to provide a specialized social network for those interested in beauty including sobjects like haircare, makeup, skincare, face yoga. The target audience is those who love beauty and want to want to share and learn about techniques, products, routines and more.

Movie Trivia was created for social purposes. It has groups created to discuss different topics related to beauty, like haircare, skincare, best products, etc.  The topic browse and activity feed are designed to facilitate the easy access to the information shared inside the groups. The users can create a username and password wich allows them to write messages, edit them, delete them and engage in interaction with other participants.

Beautypal was made as the fourth milestone project to achieve the Diploma in Software Development at the Code Institute. 

The purpose of this project is the Presentation of our first full stack project, and the main goal is to build an interactive site including both front-end and back-end that responds to the users actions, allowing them to actively engage with our website´s data from any electronic dispositive with internet access.


## UX
###  User Demographic
The user for this website is: 

- Young and adult people, the majority of them women, who are interested in beauty and the beauty indsutry. 
- Those who enjoy sharing experiences and knowledge online creating a sense of community through interaction with others with similar interests.
- Beauty lovers who are engaged with skincre, haircare, makeup and other related topics in a healthy and productive way as a contribution to their own well-being and the community's well-being.


#### User Goals

- To participate and share user’s knowledge about beauty related topics with an extended community of peers who have similar interests.
- Have a pleasent user experience when seeing an attractive website with contrasting colours as well as a clear design.
- Have a clear display of all the features available in the website in different electronic dispositives through the websites responsiveness.


## Features 

This is a one page website with a small and specialized social network that displays a name 'BeautyPal', a logo which is a free.png icon of a mirror made by (https://icons8.com/) downloaded from (https://icons8.com/icons/set/mirror). 

The website's home displays content divides in three columns bing the one in the center the widest one because it contains the feed, the columns to the left and right sides of the feed display the topic browse and the recent activity. On top of the site there's a navigation bar that has a search bar, a user's settings/login-logout dropdown menu and the logo and name of the website to the left.

Under the navigation bar there's important information about the content of the columns on the left and right sides of the site, like "Browse Topic" or "Recent Activity". The center displays a button that allows the user to create a new room to discuss a specific topic and shows the number of rooms already created and available.

All the buttons, the questions and table are easily identifiable by the contrast of the background, lines, and text.



#### Responsiveness

The site counts with responsive design. ![Am I responsive](assets/readme_files/responsiveness.png)

To be able to materialize our idea for this project I used several tutorials and I discussed it  my mentor from Code Institute Antonio Rodriguez. And even though my idea was to make a booking website at the beginning I found interesting resources and guidance online to built a little social network, which was one of the options for the fourth project to aspire to the Diploma in Software Development at the Code Institute. At the end the decission was to take the challenge and build a basic social network  website about a topic that has a lot of followers and market possibilities. I looked up to several examples online to be able to build this website, specially Traversy Media youtube channel django course wich includes guidance on how to build this kind of full stack site. 

The mentioned example of inspirational and educational site is [Traversy Media - Python Django 7 Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtQiiknWUcI). 

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The color palette was chosen by the developer based on the colors of the 'mirror icon' used as the logo of "BeautyPal", the background is dark purple inspired to give deepness and contrast to the other elements in the site, the other colors in the palette are a lighter shade of purple for the containers, blue for the accents and the search bar and coral pink for the button and other accents, the text lighter shades of grey came from the theme used as django allows such interesting features. We must say that the colors were also chosen from palettes by palette ideas shared by  [canvas.com](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/everest-springs/). This combination creates harmonious colour scheme with good contrast, and femenine notes. 


#### Typography

The typography displayed in the website is given by the theme installed according to django's posibilities, the theme and all it's components are visible in (/static/styles/style.css). Somo of theme were adapted by the developer to match the UX, our inspiration and targeted population of the BeautyPal.



## Debugging

Several bugs were detected by developer tools. The bigest one happened when trying to alter the models and settings given by django to create the user and superuser, to try and fix the error we went to stack [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/ but it could not be fixed, wich led to the duplication of the repository by cloning it causing other problems due to the need to reinstall django, environment and other tools. Code Institute's tutor, Christine Greaney-Kelley helped was fundamental to create a new workspace form the original repository and install some of the tools needed, without loosing our code.

Other types pf bugs detected were related to typos and indentation problems, the code was fixed by correcting it.


### Features to Implement in the future
- **Sounds**
     - Picture uploading would allow the users to personalize their profiles even more and would make it more "real" social network looking.
     - Notification service for interactions.
